# Vertical Pod Autoscaler FAQ

1. VPA restarts my pods but does not modify CPU or memory settings. Why?

First check that VPA admission controller is running correctly:

```$ kubectl get pod -n kube-system | grep vpa-admission-controller```

```vpa-admission-controller-69645795dc-sm88s            1/1       Running   0          1m```

Check the logs of admission controller:

```$ kubectl logs -n kube-system vpa-admission-controller-69645795dc-sm88s```

If the admission controller is up and running, but there is no indication of it
actually processing created pods or VPA objects in the logs, the webhook is not registered correctly.

Check the output of:

```$ kubectl describe mutatingWebhookConfiguration vpa-webhook-config```

This should be correctly configured to point to VPA admission webhook service.
Example:
```yaml
Name:         vpa-webhook-config
Namespace:
Labels:       <none>
Annotations:  <none>
API Version:  admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1

```

If the webhook config doesn't exist, something got wrong with webhook
registration for admission controller. Check the logs for more info.

From the above config following part defines the webhook service:
```yaml
Service:
      Name:        vpa-webhook
      Namespace:   kube-system
```

Check that the service actually exists:

```$ kubectl describe -n kube-system service vpa-webhook```

```yaml
Name:              vpa-webhook
Namespace:         kube-system
Labels:            <none>
Annotations:       <none>
Selector:          app=vpa-admission-controller
Type:              ClusterIP
IP:                <some_ip>
Port:              <unset>  443/TCP
TargetPort:        8000/TCP
Endpoints:         <some_endpoint>
Session Affinity:  None
Events:            <none>
```

You can also curl the service's endpoint from within the cluster to make sure it
is serving.

Note: the commands will differ if you deploy VPA in a different namespace.

2. How can I use Prometheus as a history provider for the VPA recommender?

Configure your prometheus to get metrics from cadvisor. Make sure that the metrics from the cadvisor have the label `job=kubernetes-cadvisor`

Set the flags `--storage=prometheus` and `--prometheus-address=<your-prometheus-address>` in the deployment for the `VPA recommender`. The `args` for the container should look something like this:

```yaml
spec:
  containers:
  - args:
    - --v=4
    - --storage=prometheus
    - --prometheus-address=http://prometheus.default.svc.cluster.local:9090
  ```

In this example, prometheus is running in the default namespace.

Now deploy the `VPA recommender` and check the logs.

```$ kubectl logs -n kube-system vpa-recommender-bb655b4b9-wk5x2```

Here you should see the flags that you set for the VPA recommender and you should see:
```Initializing VPA from history provider```

This means that the VPA recommender is now using prometheus as the history provider.
